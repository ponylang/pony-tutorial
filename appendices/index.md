# Appendix

Welcome to the appendix; the land of misshapen and forgotten documentation. Ok,
not really forgotten just.. 'lesser' sounds wrong. Some of this material could
get some loving and be promoted to a full chapter, some is always going to be an
appendix, some might be worthy of a short book unto itself. Right now though it
lives here, have a look through. You'll findlexicon of standard Pony
terminology, a symbol lookup cheatsheet that can help you locate documentation
on all our funny symbols like ^, ! and much more.
